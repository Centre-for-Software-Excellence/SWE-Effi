## TL;DR

Existing AI for software engineering leaderboards (e.g., SWE-bench [^1]) focus solely on "resolve rate", ignoring the crucial factor of effectiveness in a resource-constrained world. This is a universal problem that also exists beyond software engineering: any AI system should be more than correct—it must also be cost-effective.

We introduce SWE-Effi, a set of new metrics to re-evaluate AI systems in terms of holistic effectiveness scores. We define effectiveness as the balance between the resolve rate (the outcome) and the resources consumed (e.g., token and time). In this blog, we specifically focus on the software engineering scenario by re-ranking popular AI systems for issue resolution on a subset of the SWE-bench [^1] benchmark using these new, multi-dimensional metrics. Note that by “AI system”, we refer to a single software system that includes an AI model (LLM) with a software scaffold (e.g., agent) working together to solve a given task.

**Key Finding**:

- AI system’s effectiveness depends not just on the scaffold itself but on how well it integrates with the base model, which is key to achieving strong performance in a resource-efficient manner.
- We identified systemic challenges such as the “token snowball” effect and, more significantly, a pattern of “expensive failures.” In these cases, agents consume excessive resources while stuck on unsolvable tasks—an issue that not only limits practical deployment but also drives up the cost of failed rollouts during RL training.
- We observed a clear trade-off between effectiveness under the token budget and effectiveness under the time budget. This balance plays a crucial role in managing project budgets and enabling scalable reinforcement learning, where fast responses are essential.

## Introduction: Seeing the Full Picture

Leaderboards for benchmarks like SWE-bench [^1] provide a foundation for measuring the progress of AI coding assistants in repository-level SWE (software engineering) tasks, such as resolving issues submitted by developers. Yet, the spotlight on these leaderboards shines almost exclusively on a single metric: the resolve rate.

Current evaluation paradigms often operate on the implicit assumption of unlimited resources, but companies and developers live in a resource-constrained reality. Was the solution found in minutes, or did it burn through hours of expensive GPU time? Can a team even afford to run this agent on a daily basis? By ignoring such questions, current benchmarks create a disconnect from the realities of practical AI deployment. While our focus is on software engineering, this is a universal problem: a solution from any AI agent should be more than correct—it must also be cost-effective.

This perspective shift is critical for two key frontiers in AI-driven software development.

First, a trend emerges where agents consume massive LLM tokens (e.g., by test-time compute) to resolve one particular SWE task and earn marginal gains on leaderboards. This raises a critical question about the law of diminishing returns: Is a 1% improvement in resolve rate worth a 5x increase in cost? We argue that this path may not be the most promising direction for building truly scalable and accessible tools.

Second, agent scaffolds are increasingly being used as foundations by research teams to train smarter, self-improving models that specialize in SWE tasks through Reinforcement Learning (RL). In long-horizon RLs (like DeepResearch Agent [^2] and SkyRL [^3] training), they usually have effectiveness requirements so that the RL process won't run forever. In the SWE task scenario, each RL training step, or "rollout," involves setting up the project environment, LLM reasoning, code execution, and test validation. If an agent scaffold is slow or expensive, it hinders the entire RL process. High latency per rollout becomes a significant barrier to effective RL training, limiting progress across the community.

For instance, DeepSWE [^4] developed a custom scaffold to ensure low-latency performance for RL. The Sky-RL [^3] project uses OpenHands [^5] but requires extensive optimizations to make training feasible. Similarly, SWE-RL [^6] employs the lightweight Agentless-Mini yet avoids direct execution feedback in RL, likely due to high execution costs. These challenges arise because RL relies on massive-scale trial and error, directly affected by the scaffold's performance.

To bridge this gap, we introduce the SWE-Effi leaderboard. While not a new benchmark, we re-evaluate and analyze AI systems on top of the well-established SWE-bench [^1]. SWE-Effi offers a holistic perspective on AI system evaluation and highlights performance under resource constraints, emphasizing effectiveness under the cost budget. Moreover, SWE-Effi serves as a valuable indicator for identifying promising foundations in Reinforcement Learning for SWE tasks.

## Our Contribution

To be clear, SWE-Effi is designed to complement existing benchmarks like SWE-bench [^1]. Our primary contribution is a new evaluation perspective, metrics, and a public leaderboard. We conducted an exploratory study, which analyzed five well-known scaffoldings (AutoCodeRover [^7], SWE-agent [^8], OpenHands [^5], Agentless [^9], Agentless-Mini [^6]) paired with three different LLMs (GPT-4o-mini [^10], Llama-3.3-70b [^11], Qwen3-32b [^12]) on a representative subset of SWE-bench issues. While we tracked the final resolve rate, our main focus was on evaluating the overall AI system’s time and resource effectiveness in resolving issues and analyzing the characteristics behind it.

The findings we present are not intended to be a final, definitive verdict on these five scaffolds. Rather, they serve as an example of the deeper understanding we can unlock by looking at the same problems from a different perspective.

## Experimental Settings

To ensure our leaderboard provides meaningful and fair comparisons, we meticulously selected the baseline scaffolds and LLMs and controlled the experiment environment as described below.

Scaffold Selection and Configuration: We selected five popular, actively maintained open-source scaffolds from the top of the SWE-bench [^1] leaderboard: AutoCodeRover [^7], OpenHands [^5], SWE-agent [^8], Agentless [^9], and Agentless-mini [^6]. AutoCodeRover, Agentless and Agentless-Mini are pipeline-based scaffolds that use LLMs to solve software engineering problems in a structured workflow, whereas OpenHands and SWE-Agent are representative agentic-style scaffolds designed for software engineering tasks. They enable large language models (LLMs) to autonomously plan, edit code, and execute commands by interacting with external tools (e.g., bash), thereby facilitating end-to-end task completion. We configured those scaffolds based on their official guidelines and adhered to their default iteration or generation limits to provide a baseline for "out-of-the-box" performance, except for the termination criteria for SWE-Agent. For SWE-Agent, we adjusted its API budget to a strict $1 per issue. This forces the agent to operate under the same kind of financial pressure a real team would face.

To ensure our time duration measurements were accurate and unbiased, we explicitly disabled any parallel processing capabilities for the five scaffolds. This allowed us to measure the true, sequential processing time of each scaffold's core logic, making our time-based comparisons direct and fair.

LLM Selection: We selected models that represent a practical balance of performance and cost, making them suitable for production environments where budgets are a key consideration. To analyze performance across different resource conditions, our selection covers a range of types and sizes:

- GPT-4o-mini [^10]: A proprietary model from OpenAI, designed for high efficiency and speed. It serves as a baseline for performance in cost-sensitive scenarios.
- Llama-3.3-70b-Instruct [^11]: A large, open-source model from Meta. Its 70B parameter size provides strong, general-purpose capabilities and represents a high-performance option within the open-source ecosystem. Note that this model was already quantized to FP8 format.
- Qwen3-32b [^12]: A mid-sized, 32B parameter open-source model from Alibaba, noted for its reasoning abilities. We selected it specifically for its strong reasoning abilities relative to its size. This allows us to evaluate the performance of a more lightweight but capable alternative, which is an attractive profile for resource-constrained environments.

To use these models, we accessed GPT-4o-mini via the OpenAI API, Llama-3.3-70b via Together.AI's inference service, and Qwen3-32b via Alibaba Cloud's API. We modified the agent scaffoldings where necessary to handle specific API behaviors, such as the streaming-only output of Qwen3-32b, to ensure consistent operation.

Benchmark: We evaluated all scaffold-model combinations (each combination is a single AI system) on a focused subset of 50 issues randomly drawn from the well-respected SWE-bench-Verified dataset. To ensure this subset was a fair representation of the whole, we used stratified sampling, preserving the original distribution of issues across different software projects. This approach ensures our findings are representative while keeping the experiment manageable. We make our subset publicly available on HuggingFace.

To capture the fine-grained data for our analysis, we augmented each agent's logging and added our own profiling code (more details in the GitHub repository) to collect the precise time cost regarding local CPU computation and the backend LLM inference for each AI system.

A major obstacle in evaluating AI systems is that the absolute raw inference time depends heavily on the service provider's hardware (e.g., OpenAI vs. Together.AI), and also on the transient server load. To mitigate this, we introduce a standardized metric called **Normalized Inference Time**. The goal is to estimate how long an LLM call would have taken if it were run on a single, consistent hardware and network baseline, thereby isolating the AI system’s intrinsic workload from different backend LLM providers.

We chose OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini API as our performance baseline due to its stable and widely representative performance, and we trained a predictive linear regression model based on 515,041 individual API call logs from our experiments running five scaffolds with GPT-4o-mini. For each call, we extracted the number of input tokens, the number of output tokens, and the total wall-clock duration from sending the request to receiving the complete response.

**Linear Regression Model**: To standardize the time cost of API calls, we partitioned our full log of API requests into a 9:1 training and validation set. We then trained a linear regression model on the training data to estimate normalized inference time. The resulting model achieved a strong R² score of 0.79 on the validation set and is defined by the following equation:

<br/>
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Normalized Inference Time (s)} &= 1.457 \text{ (Fixed Overhead)} \\
&\quad + 4.266e^{-5} \times \text{(Input Tokens)} \\
&\quad + 4.999e^{-3} \times \text{(Output Tokens)}
\end{aligned}
$$

The components of this model are:

- $1.457$s (Fixed Overhead $\alpha$): The constant base latency for any API call, representing fixed costs like network round-trips and initial request processing.
- $4.266e^-5$ (Per-Input-Token Latency $\beta_1$): The time cost to process each input token, corresponding to the model's "prefill" phase.
- $4.999e^-3$ (Per-Output-Token Latency $\beta_2$): The time cost to generate each output token, corresponding to the "decoding" phase.

This validated regression model serves as our universal yardstick for standardizing time. For every LLM call made by any scaffold—no matter the model or API provider—we calculated its Normalized Inference Time by applying our formula to its input and output token counts. This process translates raw latency from different services into a single, hardware-agnostic value, representing the workload's duration on a consistent baseline. This allows for a fair and direct comparison of computational cost across all experiments.

In summary, we re-evaluate AI system performance using SWE-Effi, a suite of metrics designed to provide a holistic view. To create a standardized "score" for each dimension of effectiveness, we first calculate the Area Under the Curve (AUC) for each metric. The X-axis of each curve (e.g., tokens, cost, time) is capped at a pre-defined upper bound to ensure a consistent calculation area for all AI systems. Then, each raw AUC value is normalized into a score between 0 and 1, where 1 represents the maximum possible effectiveness within that budget. Our leaderboard is built on the following core metrics:

### Accuracy Metrics:

- Resolve Rate: The fundamental bottom line—what percentage of problems can the AI system solve?

### Effectiveness Metrics (calculated as the AUC under the respective curve):

- Effectiveness Under Token Budget (EuTB): Measures how effectively an AI system uses LLM tokens. This reflects the core computational work required by the LLM, independent of fluctuating API prices.
  - Curve: Cumulative Solved Cases vs. Total Tokens per issue (up to a 2 million token budget cap).
- Effectiveness under Cost Budget (EuCB): Assesses the AI system's real-world financial viability. While closely related to token usage, this metric translates tokens into a standardized dollar value, making the cost tangible and directly comparable to development budgets.
  - Curve: Cumulative Solved Cases vs. Monetary Cost per issue (up to 1 USD financial budget cap).
  - Note: Costs are calculated using the standardized pricing from OpenRouter as a consistent reference for our experiments, and are provided along with the source code.
- Effectiveness under CPU Time Budget (EuCTB): Measures the performance of the AI system's local logic, independent of the LLM. This reveals the framework’s own overhead.
  - Curve: Cumulative Solved Cases vs. CPU Time budget per issue (up to a 30-minute time cap).
- Effectiveness under Inference Time Budget (EuITB): Measures the AI system's LLM-related latency, standardized across different hardware backends
  - Curve: Cumulative Solved Cases vs. Normalized Inference Time per issue (up to a 30-minute time cap)

By combining this setup with our detailed measurement, we have created a leaderboard that reflects not just success, but the true cost of that success. The following sections present the data from our experiments and our initial observations.

Table 1 below presents a quantitative result of the five selected agent scaffolds, each paired with three distinct Large Language Models (LLMs), evaluated on a curated subset of the SWE-bench-Verified [^13] benchmark. The metrics reported are aggregated across all issue instances, including both resolved and unresolved issues. The columns are defined as follows:

- Total time (seconds): This metric measures the total average duration taken per one instance; calculated as the sum of the CPU and normalised inference time.
- CPU Time (seconds): This metric measures the average computational duration consumed by the AI system's scaffolding for local operations, exclusive of LLM inference latency. It serves as a proxy for the framework's intrinsic overhead and architectural complexity.
- Inference Cost (Average Inference Cost): This section delineates the computational workload delegated to the LLM. Note that the number of input tokens and output tokens is directly correlated with the financial expenditure associated with API utilization.
  - Input Tokens (k): Specifies the mean number of tokens (in thousands) provided as part of the model input.
  - Output Tokens (k): Specifies the mean number of tokens (in thousands) generated by the LLM across all issue instances.
  - Calls: Denotes the mean frequency of API requests to the LLM per trial. This metric is a key variable in our effectiveness analysis, as a high request frequency is hypothesized to induce super-linear cost scaling effects.
  - (Normalized) Inference Time (seconds): This metric quantifies the mean LLM inference time per issue instance. It serves as a proxy for the framework's intrinsic overhead and architectural complexity. It provides a single hardware-agnostic value that represents the inference workload's duration for a consistent comparison between model serving backends.
- Resolve rate (%): This metric measures the resolution rate of the issue fixes generated by the AI system. This is the main evaluation metric of the existing SWE evaluations and benchmarks today.

## Observations

Our experiments uncovered several crucial trends and trade-offs that are vital for anyone looking to build, deploy, or research AI software engineering systems. Here are our initial observations:

#### Observation 1: Scaffold Performance Is Highly Model-Dependent

Table 1 highlights that the choice of base model has a stronger impact on outcome quality than scaffold design alone. While scaffolds such as OpenHands and SWE-Agent were previously among the top performers on SWE-bench, their performance drops significantly when paired with alternative LLMs. For example, SWE-Agent paired with Qwen3-32B achieves a 28% resolution rate with 35.5 API calls and 440K input tokens, but this drops to just 10% when using GPT-4o-mini, despite requiring 181 calls and over 8.1M input tokens—more than 18× the token cost. Similarly, OpenHands achieves 34% resolution with Qwen3-32B, but falls to 12–20% when paired with GPT-4o-mini or Llama-3-70B.

In contrast, AutoCodeRover, a simpler scaffold, consistently delivers a competitive or superior performance. With Qwen3-32B, it achieves a 38% resolution rate using only 14.7 API calls and 55.5K input tokens—far more efficient than its peers. Even with GPT-4o-mini, it maintains 12% resolution, outperforming OpenHands and SWE-Agent at the same model setting. These results underscore the importance of AI system’s LLM–scaffold synergy, where the effectiveness of a scaffold is tightly coupled with the reasoning capabilities and effectiveness under token budget (EuTB) of its underlying LLM.

</h6>
<br />

Another key pattern is the performance of Agentless, which leads all scaffolds in resolution rate (48% with Qwen3-32B) but at the cost of significant computation: it consumes an average of 83.1 API calls, 209.1s inference time, and 727.9s CPU time—among the highest in the table. This is due to its default design of generating multiple repair patches and executing regression tests for each trial, trading off effectiveness for robustness.

These observations underscore the necessity of incorporating effectiveness-aware metrics—such as token usage, inference time, and call count—into AI system evaluation, as resolution rate alone may obscure the real cost of success.

#### Observation 2: High-Quality Reasoning Minimizes Iterations and Saves Tokens

Counter-intuitively, we observe that the reasoning model that consumes significantly more tokens per call can resolve issue instances with fewer total tokens. Table 1 shows that using a smaller, specialized "reasoning" model like Qwen3-32b was significantly more token-efficient than using a larger, general-purpose model like Llama-3.3-70b. While a reasoning model may be more intensive per call, it enables the AI system to solve problems with fewer API calls (e.g., 15 calls for Qwen vs. 38 for Llama with AutoCodeRover). This reveals a critical insight: the primary driver of an AI system's total cost is the number of interactions, not the intensity of each one. A smarter model that can formulate a more concise strategy saves vast amounts of tokens and time by avoiding unnecessary back-and-forth communication.

#### Observation 3: Token Snowball: Cascading Amplification of Invalid Context

  AutoCodeRover, OpenHands, and SWE-agent as a showcase.
</h6>

The above Figure 4 shows the relationship between the number of API calls per instance and the number of input tokens for each API call by that instance. As the number of calls increases, input token consumption of each API call grows steadily in both cases—but crucially, this growth is roughly linear per call. This is because most agent frameworks today adopt a naïve memory accumulation strategy, where each new LLM response is appended to the next input prompt. While simple to implement, this leads to monotonic prompt growth, with each API call adding hundreds of tokens even when the agent fails to make meaningful progress. We refer to this persistent design inefficiency as the Token Snowball Effect: even small additions to the prompt in each API call can accumulate over time, resulting into a large and often unnecessary context over long interaction trajectories. Snowball Effect not only creates excessive LLM cost and latency, but also places a cognitive burden on the model. As the context window becomes cluttered with stale information, the LLM may lose focus on relevant cues, leading to lower reasoning quality and success rate. This, in turn, causes more iterations—and further leads to continuous Token Snowball Effect.

</h6>

Figure 5 shows that the Token Snowball Effect is particularly evident in SWE-Agent with GPT-4o-mini, which frequently enters long, high-token trajectories without converging on a fix. By contrast, ACR with Qwen3-32B tends to terminate earlier, often solving issues with fewer API calls and lower token usage overall. This highlights the necessity for developing better budget management strategies and more advanced memory abstraction techniques. Better budget management strategies can help balance the effectiveness of scaffolding in solving problems with budget constraints—by halting the task if the token usage snowballs to an unacceptable level, especially since continuing would likely not resolve the issue anyway. Meanwhile, better memory abstraction techniques can help reduce the rapid growth of token snowball.

#### Observation 4: Failing is Far More Expensive Than Succeeding

  Figure 6 - Token consumption differences between successfully resolved and
  unresolved issues
</h6>
<br />

Table 1 also compares resource usage between resolved (R) and unresolved (U) issues. We can observe a trend that unresolved issues tend to consume more resources on average (Figure 6), including longer inference time, higher token usage, and more execution steps, indicating inefficiencies in failure cases.
Take SWE-Agent with GPT-4o-mini as an example: a failed attempt consumes over 8.8 million tokens and 658 seconds, while a successful one requires just 1.8 million tokens and 167.2 seconds. That’s more than a 4x increase in both inference time and token cost when the agent is off track. The same pattern holds elsewhere—OpenHands with LLaMA-3.3-70B takes 238.9 seconds on average when it fails, compared to 79 seconds when it succeeds. Even efficient scaffolds like AutoCodeRover aren’t immune: a failure often takes nearly three times as long as a success.

This “fail expensively” behavior highlights a critical capability gap: the lack of futility detection. When AI systems are on a productive path, they often reach a solution efficiently. But when they’re stuck, they enter expensive, repetitive loops, consuming massive amounts of compute until an external budget limit is reached. These hidden costs pose a serious challenge for real-world deployment. Future research may explore how scaffolds can become **progress-aware**, identifying signals of stagnation—analogous to **code smells in software engineering**—and learning to **abort or redirect unproductive trajectories** before problem-solving spirals out of control.

## Conclusion

In this work, we explored an evaluation paradigm for AI software engineering systems that extends beyond the primary metric of resolve rate. It is crucial to highlight that while our experiments were conducted on the SWE-bench benchmark, the insights gained are not confined to software engineering. The systemic issues we identified—such as the "Token Snowball" effect and the pattern of "expensive failures"—are likely fundamental challenges for any autonomous AI system designed to solve complex, multi-step problems in any domain. Our analysis of five popular scaffolds in combination with three popular LLMs surfaced several key observations with direct implications for future research:

- We observe that an AI system's success is not determined by the scaffold alone but by its synergy with the base model. This interplay is crucial for achieving high performance efficiently.
- We identified a clear trade-off between effectiveness under cost budget (tokens) and effectiveness under time budget (latency). This choice directly impacts both a project's budget and the feasibility of large-scale Reinforcement Learning, where low latency is critical for training.
- We observed systemic issues like the "Token Snowball" effect and, most critically, a tendency for AI systems to "fail expensively." This behavior—where AI system get stuck in resource-intensive loops on unsolvable problems—not only hinders their real-world use but also poses a significant barrier to effective RL training by making each failed "rollout" prohibitively costly.

  Our findings demonstrate that an AI system's underlying architecture and effectiveness profile are strong predictors of its long-term potential. A lightweight framework that avoids expensive failure modes is not only a more practical tool today but also a more "evolvable" foundation for the Reinforcement Learning approaches that will shape the future of AI in software engineering. We hope the SWE-Effi framework provides a valuable contribution to the community, guiding us toward building AI systems that are both powerful and practical.
